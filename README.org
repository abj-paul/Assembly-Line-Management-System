* Assembly Line Management System

A government-funded project on the *Remittance Garments Industry*, conducted under *Dr. Md. Shoyaib* in collaboration with *Versatile Garments Ltd.*  
This project integrates *requirement-driven software engineering* with *machine learning pipelines* to optimize factory workflows, automate reporting, and detect congestion in garment assembly lines.

---

* Overview
- Conducted *on-site requirement collection*, including one month‚Äôs assembly line logs at Versatile Garments Ltd.  
- Produced a *131-page Software Requirements Specification (SRS)* and an *88-page Software Design Document (SDD)*.  
- Developed a full-stack system using *NodeJS, TypeScript, Angular, FastAPI, and MySQL*.  
- Designed to be lightweight: capable of running *20 real-time detection pipelines on a 4GB RAM, Core i3 CPU*.

* Core Features
- ‚ö° Automatic Congestion Detection ‚Äì Live monitoring using NMF with Œ≤-divergence.  
- üè≠ Automated Assembly Line Layout Generation ‚Äì From product design to workstation mapping.  
- üîÑ Automated Line Balancing ‚Äì Dynamically adjusts workload across stations.  
- üìä Automated Report Generation ‚Äì Quality reports, congestion logs, and line efficiency.  
- üë• User Interaction Module ‚Äì Supervisor dashboards, workstation marking, and access control.  

---

* Research & Experimentation
- Applied *Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)* for congestion detection, with focus on:
  - Noise reduction  
  - Local geometry identification  
  - Global geometry preservation  
- Chosen algorithm: *NMF with Œ≤-divergence* for robust performance under noisy factory data.
