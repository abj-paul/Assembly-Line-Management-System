* Assembly Line Management System

A government-funded project on the *Remittance Garments Industry*, conducted under *Dr. Md. Shoyaib* in collaboration with *Versatile Garments Ltd.*  
This project integrates *requirement-driven software engineering* with *machine learning pipelines* to optimize factory workflows, automate reporting, and detect congestion in garment assembly lines.


* Overview
- Conducted *on-site requirement collection*, including one month’s assembly line logs at Versatile Garments Ltd.  
- Produced a *131-page Software Requirements Specification (SRS)* and an *88-page Software Design Document (SDD)*.  
- Developed a full-stack system using *NodeJS, TypeScript, Angular, FastAPI, and MySQL*.  
- Designed to be lightweight: capable of running *20 real-time detection pipelines on a 4GB RAM, Core i3 CPU*.  


* Core Features
- ⚡ Automatic Congestion Detection – Live monitoring using NMF with β-divergence.  
- 🏭 Automated Assembly Line Layout Generation – From product design to workstation mapping.  
- 🔄 Automated Line Balancing – Dynamically adjusts workload across stations.  
- 📊 Automated Report Generation – Quality reports, congestion logs, and line efficiency.  
- 👥 User Interaction Module – Supervisor dashboards, workstation marking, and access control.  


* Research & Experimentation
- Applied *Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)* for congestion detection, with focus on:
  - Noise reduction  
  - Local geometry identification  
  - Global geometry preservation  
- Chosen algorithm: *NMF with β-divergence* for robust performance under noisy factory data.  


* Documentation
- [[./Software Requirements Specification - Assembly Line Management System for Versatile Garments Ltd..pdf][Software Requirements Specification (SRS) – 131 pages]]  
- [[./Report.org][Software Design Document (SDD) – 88 pages]]  
- [[./Bugs.org][Congestion Detection with NMF + β-divergence Notes]]  


* Development & Planning
- Phase 1 – Requirement collection, login system, initial assembly line layout.  
- Phase 2 – Core feature development (detection, balancing, reporting).  
- Phase 3 – Frontend integration with Angular, access control, and supervisor tools.  

* Impact
This system demonstrates how *AI-assisted monitoring* and *automated assembly line design* can improve efficiency, reduce bottlenecks, and enhance workforce productivity in Bangladesh’s *garments sector* — a cornerstone of the country’s remittance economy.
