 1. App crashes (throw err): Solution - It is not a bug rather a feature of development. We want error to occur everytime something does not go as expected.
 2. Layout: Total production should include sum of bottleneck of all lines.
 3. Select LC for each assembly line
 4. Add "action" column in notification table
* Todo
** LC Workflow
1. [X] Make backend for layout view
2. [X] Make Frontend for layout view
3. [X] Register LC
4. [X] Assign LC
5. [ ] Save total target in some table (e.g. assembly line, production, hourly report)
6. [X] Notify LC on assignment
7. [X] Notify LC on layout set
8. [X] LC Access Control
9. [ ] LC Views notification on layout change and clicks it to see the layout
10. [ ] Request Resource form, this will need a separate table
11. [ ] Set Production Target for each machine
** Congestion
- [ ] Congestion table
- [ ] API that requests for congestion check after 10s and updates the table
- [ ] API that returns 1 or 0
- [ ] On load, the congestion layout view will have borders in it for congestion.
